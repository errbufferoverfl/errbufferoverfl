### üë§ &nbsp;About Me

<img align="right" alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1316325058499944448/mIOSbACJ_400x400.jpg" />

I'm a non-binary (**they/sie/ze**) anarchic gardener, knowledge librarian, and security engineer by trade, I work at Canva as an Application Security engineer, focusing on building out a Partnerships function and helping to build a secure app ecosystem. I currently live on the unceded land of the Wadawurrung and Dja Dja Wurrung People. I'm an anti-capitalist in training, future subsistence farmer, and can often be found:

- üíæ creating patchwork quilts of code snippets and infrastructure, deep-diving technological standards and exploring all the ways teaching sand to think was a mistake. 

- üñãÔ∏è drawing or printing anarchic and technology themed badges, prints and designs on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/errbufferoverfl).

- üóûÔ∏è curating the ‚ú®vibes‚ú® and compiling zines that magnify marginalized voices in information security, providing a space for people to publish pieces that are messy, unpolished or don't have any expressed value under capitalism.

Some personal highlights include:
- üóû USB Canary, a small proof of concept tool I built while between jobs was featured in [Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/usb-canary-sends-an-sms-when-someone-tinkers-with-your-usb-ports/) in 2017.

### üé§ &nbsp;Meetups, Conferences and Training Appearances

#### 2021

##### [Conference] Collapsology: Why your biggest threat isn‚Äôt exposed RDP - September 2021

For decades, anthropologists, quantitative historians, and sociologists have discussed and proposed various explanations for the collapse of civilizations, from unsustainable complexity, decay of social cohesion, rising inequality and general misfortune.

Using our time-travelling phone booth, we‚Äôll investigate historical collapses and conduct a root cause analysis to investigate why these collapses happened, and how we can observe similar issues in modern business environments.

This talk provides an overview of how to identify cultural threats in a rapidly evolving business landscape, and how we can use modern-day tools to identify these threats before they result in security culture collapse.

#### 2019

##### [Debate] The Big Cloud Security Debate: Hackers vs Security Engineers - November 2019

A debate organised by ANZ, Contino and Meetup Madness where 4 hackers vs 4 security experts engaging in a fiery debate to determine all the ways they can hack and defend cloud environments. errbufferoverfl participated as part of the "hackers"/"red team".

##### [Conference] A Brief History of Tamper Evident Locks - October 2019

A talk that discussed common "canary locks" or locks with tamper evident mechanisms through the ages, Buffy trawlled through 11,335,427 patents to identify several high and low profile locks and their known, or speculated bypass techniques.

##### [Training] Snake Charming for Beginners - April 2019

Snake-charming is an age-old practice of hypnotizing snakes by playing and waving a murli - in the modern day this practice looks much different, equipped with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), a clackity keyboard and a trusty guide we'll be taking you through how you can effectively charm Python 3.6.

On the first day of our trek through the dense jungles of Pythonia we will be looking at how to build a simple sub-domain enumeration tool and how to get started building simple exploits - for those who have trekked these paths before - extra challenges will await you. 

Day two we will move further into the dark jungles of Pythonia delving into forbidden user-land territory and how you can use Python to gather useful system-level information, and contact the UNIX daemons of old.

While writing this training description, errbufferoverfl wrote two Python fan fictions, the next cyber-themed Hollywood blockbuster and Shakespearian a play about the training.
